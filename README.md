Arma 3 - Fluid Door Opening
================================

A very rough proof of concept of fluid door opening
 
What is it?
--------------------------------
 
This addon enables you to hold a key, then roll your mouse wheel to incrementally open doors and hatches.
 
What key do I hold?
--------------------------------
 
By default, the hold key is TAB, but you can change it to anything you fancy through CBA's keybind menu. Just hit ESC then go Configure > Controls > Configure Addons. Here, select "TEN Fluid Door Opening" from the "ADDONS" dropdown menu and change the "Fluid Door Opening (Hold + Mouse Wheel)" to anything that you find comfortable. Please do try to avoid key conflicts.
 
My action menu and crosshair disappear while I hold the "Fluid Door Opening" button!
--------------------------------
 
This is intended. It prevents the mouse wheel from scrolling the action menu while you are opening doors. Sadly the crosshair is bundled in the same subset of the command that the action menu is.
 
The doors are no longer animate silky smooth!
--------------------------------
 
As BI added door animation sounds, there is no longer a way to play animations without sound, unless you do it with the instant param. I chose to go with no sounds, but rougher animation so you can be at least slightly sneaky.
 
I'm on Dev branch, the doors open, but I can't pass through them!?
--------------------------------
 
Yeaaaaaaaaaaah. Ticket for your voting pleasure [here](http://feedback.arma3.com/view.php?id=25654). If this ends up on stable, we'll have to go back to squeaking doors.
 
Dependencies?
--------------------------------
 
@CBA_A3 - Keybind handling, until BI comes up with a better solution
 
SHOW ME!
